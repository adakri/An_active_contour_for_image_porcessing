# Level set methods and image processing project for MMIS 3A ENSIMAG

**NOTE** I have ported most of my school projects (rather hastely) because my gitlab subscription was going to expire and with it evry bit of (some would say poorly written) code I have written. But for nostalgia's sake why not ! (I also find myself more than I want to coming back to bits and pieces of code I used).

This project was part of the aformentionned course and in which the paper **Active contour model driven by local histogram fitting energy** by Weiping Liu, Yanfeng Shang, Xin Yang was implemented. It is an active contour method for image segmentation. The *nt_toolbox* needs to be dowloaded (static python librairy) in the appropriate folder. Please see the report and presentation for more details.
